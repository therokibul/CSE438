Use Case: Collaborate on a Note

Primary Actor: User

Preconditions:
- The user has a registered account and is logged into the note-taking app.
- The user has created at least one note.
- The user has identified another user to collaborate with.

Postconditions:
- The note is successfully shared and collaboration is enabled between the users.

Main Flow:
1. The user selects a note they want to collaborate on from their list of notes.
2. The user chooses the option to collaborate on the selected note.
3. The app presents the user with options to invite collaborators.
4. The user enters the email address or username of the collaborator they want to invite.
5. The app validates the collaborator's email address or username and confirms their availability for collaboration.
6. The user sends an invitation to the collaborator.
7. The collaborator receives an invitation notification via email or app notification.
8. The collaborator accepts the invitation and opens the note.
9. Both the user and collaborator can now view and edit the note simultaneously.
10. Changes made by either the user or collaborator are automatically synchronized and updated for both parties.
11. The app tracks and displays the respective authors of changes made in the note.
12. The user and collaborator can continue to collaborate on the note, making edits and additions as needed.
13. When finished, either the user or collaborator can choose to save the changes and close the collaboration session.
14. The note is saved with the changes made during collaboration and remains accessible to both the user and collaborator.
15. Collaboration on the note can be resumed at any time by either the user or collaborator.

Alternative Flows:
- If the collaborator declines the invitation (Step 8), the user receives a notification and can choose to invite another collaborator or continue working on the note individually.
- If the user or collaborator encounters any technical issues or connectivity problems during collaboration, the app should provide appropriate error messages and options to retry or troubleshoot the issue.

Extensions:
- The app may provide additional collaboration features such as commenting, mentioning collaborators, or setting permissions for specific collaborators.

Note: This use case focuses on the collaboration aspect of the note-taking app. There may be other use cases related to note creation, editing, organization, and individual usage scenarios that can be developed in detail.
