Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for Cloud-Based Note-Taking App with Collaboration (Unote)

1. Introduction
   1.1 Purpose
   The purpose of this document is to define the requirements for a cloud-based note-taking application that allows users to create, manage, and collaborate on notes.

   1.2 Scope
   The note-taking app will be accessible via web browsers and mobile devices (iOS and Android). It will support basic note-taking functionalities such as creating, editing, and organizing notes. Additionally, the app will provide collaboration features, allowing multiple users to collaborate on the same note simultaneously.

   1.3 Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations
   - SRS: Software Requirements Specification
   - iOS: Apple's mobile operating system
   - Android: Google's mobile operating system

2. Overall Description
   2.1 Product Perspective
   The note-taking app will function as a standalone web and mobile application. It will leverage cloud infrastructure to store and sync notes across multiple devices.

   2.2 User Classes and Characteristics
   The application will cater to the following user classes:
   - Individual Users: Users who want to create and manage personal notes.
   - Collaborative Users: Users who require real-time collaboration and sharing of notes with others.

   2.3 Operating Environment
   The note-taking app will be compatible with modern web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) and mobile devices running iOS and Android operating systems.

   2.4 Design and Implementation Constraints
   - The app should be designed with a responsive user interface for a seamless user experience across different devices.
   - The app should leverage secure authentication and authorization mechanisms to protect user data.

3. Functional Requirements
   3.1 User Registration and Authentication
   - Users must be able to create an account by providing their Gmail Account.
   - Users should be able to log in securely to access their notes and collaboration features.

   3.2 Note Management
   - Users should be able to create, edit, and delete notes.
   - Notes should support rich text formatting, including headings, lists, and basic formatting options (bold, italic, etc.).

   3.3 Collaboration Features
   - Users should be able to invite other users to collaborate on a note.
   - Collaborative users should be able to view and edit the note.
   - Changes made by one user should be reflected immediately for all collaborators.

   3.4 Synchronization
   - Notes and changes made by users should be synchronized across all their devices.

4. Non-Functional Requirements
   4.1 Performance
   - The application should have low latency to provide a smooth and responsive user experience.
   - Synchronization of notes and changes should be fast and efficient.

   4.2 Security
   - User authentication and authorization should be implemented securely.
   - User data, including notes and collaborative activities, should be encrypted during transmission and storage.

   4.3 Usability
   - The user interface should be intuitive and user-friendly, allowing users to quickly navigate and perform tasks.
   - Support for accessibility features should be provided to cater to users with disabilities.

   4.4 Scalability
   - The application should be designed to handle a growing number of users and notes without sacrificing performance.

5. System Requirements
   5.1 Hardware Requirements
   - Web browser with internet connectivity
   - Mobile device running iOS or Android

   5.2 Software Requirements
   - Compatible web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
   - iOS 12 or later for iOS devices
   - Android 7.0 or later for Android devices

6. Glossary
   - SRS: Software Requirements Specification
   - iOS: Apple's mobile operating system
   - Android: Google's mobile operating system

Note: This SRS provides a high-level overview of the requirements for a cloud-based note-taking app with collaboration features. Further discussions, design, and development iterations are necessary to refine and elaborate on these requirements.
